        <p>
            We had the choice to design a 24” x 36” digital poster about either one of the following:
            <p>1) your life under COVID 19</p>
            <p>2) how you see the future of design</p> 
            <p>*without using software explicitly intended for design.*</p>
            
            In this assignment you will see all my spending habits during covid. It is quite embarassing to show and it will definetly show that I possibly have a shopping problem. Throughtout this exploration you will have full access to all my spending habits and bills during the pandemic.

            For this I used an inconventional tool to make a collage on Excel to be more specific I did it on google sheets which gives me less acess and features than Excel. As I used the program I realized it is qute resstricted and dose not give me much options. But I did utilize the graph tool to make me several different looking graphs to be added into the collage.

        <p>This is a majority of what I found regardign all the purchases made durign peek pandemic. Many of them were impulse buys as it was for my hobbies and gifts, but some more more reasonable like food and etc. You can see all my buys thats could or could not be justified, but it did make my pendemic enjoyable.</p>
